Description: Simplifies the generation of customized R Markdown PDF
    templates.  A template may include an individual logo, typography,
    geometry or color scheme. The package provides a skeleton with
    detailed instructions for customizations. The skeleton can be modified
    by changing defaults in the 'YAML' header, by adding additional
    'LaTeX' commands or by applying dynamic adjustments in R. Individual
    corporate design elements, such as a title page, can be added as R
    functions that produce 'LaTeX' code.
